This project is supposed to serve as the back-end for an e-commerce site.

I've been able to set up a database and seed data, and I've made some progress with the functionality on the back end but I'm having trouble getting the route handler function to work.

It always runs the catch-all route instead of anything in the API folder. I'm turning this is now, but plan to revisit after project 2 when hopefully I'll understand this better.
